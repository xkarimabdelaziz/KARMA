# Karma — Intelligent Adaptive Learning Platform

Karma is an inclusive, AI-powered adaptive learning platform designed to support students with ADHD and hearing impairments.

Instead of forcing students to adapt to traditional education systems, Karma adapts the learning experience to fit each student’s cognitive and sensory needs — quietly and respectfully.

## 🌍 The Problem

Traditional education systems are designed for the “average” student.

They often fail to support:
- Students with ADHD who struggle with focus and distraction
- Deaf and hard-of-hearing students who rely on visual learning and sign language
- Students who require personalized pacing and structured content

This creates:
- Lower academic performance
- Increased dropout rates
- Psychological stress
- Educational inequality

---

## 💡 Our Solution

Karma provides an adaptive learning experience that adjusts content presentation based on the student’s needs — without labeling or isolating them.

Teachers or parents configure student profiles in the background, ensuring psychological safety and a natural learning experience.
